First of all we prepared our C code inside the "In" folder. So, read the input file and with the help of following functions converted it to the ".txt" format named "new.txt":

1. **remove_Comments** :  With the help of this function, we omit the comments (//,/**/) and return it as a result.

2. **removeSpaces** :  With the help of this function, we omit the ("/n) of the code

3. **replaceIncludes** :  With the help of this function, we get access of the library and replace file with "include"

4. **replaceDefines** :  With the help of this function, we convert the aforementioned word with its real value.

5. **PreProcess function** :  The parent function whitch calls above functions as a whole unit and save the result in "new.txt" file.
